# Leaves Measuring Android App

This app allows you to measure the area of leaves by color difference from around leaves.
(It may apply to other measuring.)

## Usage
1. Take a picture or scan leaves you want to measure. This need to include a ruler.  
I recommend you use different color to foreground and background.
If foreground color and background color are same, this app distinguish leaves from background.  
2. Open this app and tap file icon and choose picture you took.
3. Slide a seek bar to adjust grid. A square corresponds to 1cm.
